        <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
        <p>When I was younger, I struggled with seeing myself being happy in a job. I dreaded the thought of being stuck in a
        dead-end career, doing busy-work for hours on end. On the other hand, I knew even at 15 that I wanted some form
        of stability; I loved art, but I couldn't imagine myself making a career out of it. I wondered if there was any chance I
        could find a field that could engage my mind and possibly allow me to do something creative while also providing
        me with financial stability. My answer came in the form of Mr. Thomas' Intro to Programming class.
        Mr. Thomas was an older man and devout Swiftie who once worked for NASA and the U.S. Air Force and
        eventually found himself teaching various STEM classes at an all-girls Catholic high school in the Chicago suburbs.
        He was strange in the way all of the best teachers are, and he had a genuine passion for teaching and getting young
        people interested in science. His class taught me that not only was programming something I was capable of doing,
        it was something I found fun. I loved learning to wrap my mind around machine logic. Using it to solve problems,
        and being rewarded with tangible proof of my solution by way of my projects actually working, was exhilarating. I
        still loved arts and the humanities, but now I knew another way I could engage my mind and even be creative while
        doing so. After all, machine logic may have been black and white, but the fun quizzes we made and websites we
        designed using it were anything but. Two years and a different school later, an amazing job shadowing experience at
        John Deere's Chicago tech hub introduced me to UI/UX design while a summer camp gave me a crash course on
        beginner's web development. Suddenly, I didn't just know what I wanted to do with my life, I had options.
        For me, what is most important in a future career is the chance to problem-solve, in whatever form that may take.
        Whether it is determining the cause of a seg-fault or deciding which color scheme will work best for a business card,
        I love approaching problems methodically and finding successful solutions. That is what eventually drew me to
        UI/UX design: it blends the creative nature of art with the solution-oriented outlook of computer science. It is using
        art to solve problems, meet goals, and deliver enjoyable experiences to customers. I know that UI/UX is often
        under-appreciated, but that is what makes it interesting to me – the idea of doing a job so well that no one even
        notices, creating an experience so seamless and intuitive people don't have to think about it.
        UI/UX design isn't the only potential career path I am interested in. I find graphic design appealing for the many of
        the same reasons: getting to meet a customer's needs through art, curate an aesthetic to intentionally communicate
        with consumers, and seamlessly blend form and function into a beautiful final product. I am also interested in
        careers that are more programming-heavy, such as web development. I find searching for efficient solutions to be
        incredibly rewarding, and I love the challenge of thinking like a machine. Regardless of what I end up pursuing, I
        know that I want a career where I can be engaged, solve problems, and exercise my mind in new and exciting ways.
        Looking forward, I hope to not just dip my toes into the waters of the future, but dive right in and see what I find.</p>
