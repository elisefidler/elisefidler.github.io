        <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
        <p>My name is Elise Fidler. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from 
        the University of Missouri and expect to graduate in May 2027. I am interested in a 
        career in web development and/or UI/UX design. I enjoy exploring how to create 
        effective designs that enhance user experiences. Ultimately, my goal is to create 
        enjoyable online experiences through a fusion of form and functionality. <br> <br>
        Currently, I am on the graphic design team for Mizzou's annual hackathon, 
        <em>TigerHacks</em>. I have also done design work for Mizzou Res Life. When I am not 
        doing schoolwork, I enjoy working on personal art projects, experimenting with graphic 
        design software, and going on long walks. I also enjoy spending time with my family and 
        friends (<em>including my two cats and dog</em>) back home in Chicago. I am presently 
        looking for internship opportunities that involve front-end programming and/or graphic
        design work.</p>
        <h3><strong>Education Overview</strong></h3>
        <p>I am a sophomore pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University 
        of Missouri's College of Engineering. I expect to graduate in spring 2027. I plan to 
        focus on web development and UI/UX design.</p>
