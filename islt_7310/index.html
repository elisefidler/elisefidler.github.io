        <h3>Hello, and welcome to my website!</h3>

        <!--Logo or related graphic will be placed here-->

        <h3>My name is Elise Fidler – here you can find 
        everything you need to know about me.</h3>
        
        <p>This website is intended to be a professional website used for showing off my career 
        path, goals, and skills to potential employers. On this site, you will find examples of 
        past positions I have held and projects I have completed, a copy of my resume, and text 
        explaining who I am and what I am passionate about. The site is also intended to be a
        project in and of itself – evidence of my programming knowledge and design sensibilities. 
        My goal is to create a hub for conveniently finding relevant information about me and my 
        abilities that you can browse at your leisure. If anything on this website catches your 
        eye, or you have questions, please do not hesitate to navigate to the contact page and 
        reach out. I hope that after browsing my website, you will understand who I am and how I 
        can be an asset to your organization.</p>
