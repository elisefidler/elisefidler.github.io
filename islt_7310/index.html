            <p>This website is intended to be a professional website used for showing off my career 
            path, goals, and skills to potential employers. On this site, you will find examples of 
            past positions I have held and projects I have completed, a copy of my resume, and text 
            explaining who I am and what I am passionate about. The site is also intended to be a
            project in and of itself – evidence of my programming knowledge and design sensibilities. 
            My goal is to create a hub for conveniently finding relevant information about me and my 
            abilities that you can browse at your leisure. If anything on this website catches your 
            eye, or you have questions, please do not hesitate to navigate to the contact page and 
            reach out. I hope that after browsing my website, you will understand who I am and how I 
            can be an asset to your organization.</p>
